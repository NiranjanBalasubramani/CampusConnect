# Campus-Connect
The idea is to build a social networking site to bridge the gap between the students and lecturers of RNSIT. An online portal where queries can be made regarding subjects, assignments and doubts to be clarified. All notes would be put up on the website and students would be intimated regarding all the activities happening at RNSIT. A student can login using his USN and a password for his security. Since RNSIT doesn't have an online platform to interact, we hope this project would be helpful in the long run as well.
